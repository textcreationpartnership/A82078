            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas the great neglect of divers perſons within the City of <hi>London,</hi> hath occaſioned too many delayes in raiſing Money for ſupply of the Army, and other Forces of the Kingdome; His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and the General-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Army, Doth declare, That they take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the great wants of the Souldiery, both of the Army, and other Forces, and Garriſons; as alſo of the ſufferings of the County, in reſpect of free quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p n="1">I. <hi>That for what time their defauls or delayes have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, and ſhall further occaſion the Armies ſtay here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, the charge thereof ſhould ſome way be laid upon them, and their adherents about the City.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>This Declaration was agreed upon at the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters at <hi>Putney,</hi> upon Thurſday laſt, there being a Generall Councell of the Army appointed to be held every Thurſday. The Generall Councell met in the Church, the Generall, many Generall Officers, Field-Officers, inferiour Officers, and Agitators met. A great part of the time was ſpent in conſideration, and debate of the Propoſals of the Army, and ſome few things agreed upon to be altered, and explained in them, which no doubt will give much ſatisfaction to the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>After the aforeſaid Declaration was finiſhed, it was, by the appointment of his Excellency, and the Councell of Warre, ſent to the Right Honourable the Commiſſioners of Lords and Commons reſiding with the Army, to be preſented from them to both Houſes of Parliament, which according, with a Letter from the Generall and Army, to this effect, <hi>vix.

            <p>Much time were ſpent, touching divers weighty buſineſſes in behalfe of the whole Kingdome, concerning the peace, and future ſafety; as alſo ſome things debated upon in reference to the Propoſalls, that after the Rights, Liberties, Peace and ſafety of the Kingdome being provided for, the Kings Majeſties Royall perſon, his Gonſort the Queena, their Highneſſes, <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales, James</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the reſt of the Royall Iſſue, may be reſtored to a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſafety, honour, and freedome in this Nation, without diminution to their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
